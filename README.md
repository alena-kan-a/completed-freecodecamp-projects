# Completed freeCodeCamp Projects

This is my repository where I store all the certification projects I have done for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Certifications.
I was using promts and instructions, as well as requirements to the projects provided by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), but the code is my own.
Some text in some of the projects was generated by AI (see README for each project).
