  <header><h2>Introduction</h2></header>
  <p>This documentation on our cat, Nepenthe, is written in case we are away and need someone to take care of her. She is the sweetest girl but, as any cat, she has her unique character and needs.</p>
  <p>She never uses her claws and she never bites so taking care of her will not be difficult unless you bother her too much — in that case she will simply hide somewhere, and you will have trouble finding her.</p>

  <header><h2>Description</h2></header>
  <p>Nepenthe is a female 3-year-old Siberian cat. She is bicolor, with white body and dark grey spots on her face and paws. She has blue eyes, and she wears white “socks” on her front paws while her back paws are fully white with the exception of a few dark grey spots. The inside of her ears is pink, and her nose is mostly pink except a small grey spot on the right side of her nose. Her tail is light grey with darker spots.</p>
  <p>She is very calm and gentle most of the time, and she is more playful and active during evening hours. However, she is very timid and is easily scared by unexpected sounds or actions.</p>
  <p>She is an exceptionally well-behaved cat. She only uses her claws on scratchers, always uses her toilet, never steals anyone’s food and does not do anything naughty in general.</p>

<section class="main-section" id="Communication">
  <header><h2>Communication</h2></header>
  <p>Although Nepenthe is her official name, we mostly call her <code>Penny</code> or <code>Penpen</code> when talking to her. We recommend doing the same for her to understand that she is being called.</p>
  <span>Languages Nepenthe understands:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>English</li>
    <li>Japanese</li>
    <li>French</li>
    <li>Russian</li>
  </ul>
  <p>However, she hears English most often, so we recommend using English if possible.</p>
  <p>She is very curious about smells, so let her smell things if she comes to check them out. However, do be careful about potentially strong smells and maintain some distance between Nepenthe and the object. She will come closer if necessary.</p>
  <p>We do not recommend talking in loud voices around Nepenthe, as well as touching her too much.</p>

<section class="main-section" id="How_to_feed">
  <header><h2>How to feed</h2></header>
  <p>We feed Nepenthe twice a day: at 8 am and at 7 pm.</p>
  <h3>8 am</h3>
  <p>Her dishes should be washed, and water should be changed at this time.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a pack of wet food (85 g)</li>
    <li>some dry food (30 g)</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>7 pm</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>a can of canned food (80 g)</li>
    <li>some dry food (30 g)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If there is anything left in the dishes, be sure to throw it away before giving Nepenthe fresh food.</p>

<section class="main-section" id="How_to_play">
  <header><h2>How to play</h2></header>
  <p>Nepenthe may be too sleepy or too lazy to play in the morning or during the day, so we recommend playing with her in the evening.</p>
  <p>She has two favourite toys: any sort of ribbon and a small plush toy (red panda head). </p>
  <h3>Ribbon</h3>
  <p>May be replaced with a shoe lace.</p>
  <p>She likes to catch the ribbon, though she needs to start slow. Play with a ribbon close to her first, and try moving around the apartment with it after she is engaged. She loves catching the ribbon on the bed.</p>
  <h3>Plush toy</h3>
  <p>She usually plays with it on her own but if you throw it around she enjoys catching it and bringing it back (yes, like a dog).</p>

  <header><h2>How to take care of her toilet</h2></header>
  <p>We use the litter that can be flushed in the toilet.</p>
  <p>Please be sure to remove the lumpy parts of her litter: it means she has peed there.</p>
  <p>We recommend fully changing her litter at least once a week.</p>

<section class="main-section" id="What_not_to_do">
  <header><h2>What not to do</h2></header>
  <span>Here is a list of things you should not do around Nepenthe or to Nepenthe:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>do not disturb her when she is in her bed</li>
    <li>do not pet her too much</li>
    <li>do not carry her unless absolutely necessary</li>
    <li>avoid loud sounds around her</li>
    <li>never leave an open window if she is out of your sight</li>
    <li>whenever possible, use a sweep broom and/or a mop instead of vacuum cleaner</li>
    <li>never leave yarn/strings/shoe laces/ribbons unattended and put them away after playing</li>
    <li>avoid feeding her at times other than described above</li>
    <li><code>never</code> punish her for anything</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Brushing her or clipping her claws can be challenging, so we will take care of it when we are back.</p>
  <p>If there is something unavoidable that will cause Nepenthe stress, please be sure to give her a <code>churu</code> after that (top shelf in the cupboard).</p>

  <header><h2>In case of emergency</h2></header>
  <p>If anything happens, please contact Alena or Mathieu immediately.</p>
  <p>Here is the <a href="">address</a> of the closest <code>vet clinic</code>. Be sure to take Nepenthe’s medical insurance from the top desk drawer if you go to a clinic.</p>
